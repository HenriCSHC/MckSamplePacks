# MckSamplePacks

Samples of my drum machines.

## Why?

I made recordings of my drum machines / synthesizers to use them in a different context without the need to have the hardware available.

I also want to be able to provide some factory content for my [MckSampler](https://github.com/HenriCSHC/MckSampler) drum sampler software.
